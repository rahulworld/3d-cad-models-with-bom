# CAD 3D Model Viewer and BOM Tool

## Overview

This project is a React-based web application designed to allow users to upload CAD 3D models, view and interact with them, and display a Bill of Materials (BOM). The tool also provides functionality to highlight specific components within the 3D models.

## Features

- 3D Model Upload: Upload CAD files in various formats (e.g., STEP/STP).
- Interactive 3D Viewer: View, rotate, zoom, and pan 3D models directly in the browser.
- Component Highlighting: Highlight individual components within the 3D model for better visualization.
- Bill of Materials (BOM) Display: Automatically generate and display a BOM associated with the uploaded model.
